# Proposed Timeline for Level 1

This timeline aims to help anyone in tacking the different topics in level with suggested pace. This is not a rigid timeline whatsoever. Instead of treating it as a set of absolute deadlines, think of it as a good starting point which you can customize further for your learning pace and available time.
